/*
Create a struct that represents a House
It should store:
 - The address of the house
 - The price in EUR
 - The number of rooms
 - The area of the house in square meters
The market price of the houses is 400 EUR / square meters
Create a function that takes a pointer to a house and decides if it's worth to buy
(if the price is lower than the calculated price from it's area)
Create a function that takes an array of houses (and it's length), and counts the
houses that are worth to buy.
